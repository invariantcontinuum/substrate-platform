# Structural Integrity Platform (Substrate)

**Substrate Platform** is a governance layer over modern software delivery — powered by a live knowledge graph and an internal integration marketplace.

AI has massively accelerated code creation but often at the cost of architectural consistency, security guarantees, and shared understanding. This platform restores control, visibility, and confidence by governing AI-generated code and preserving architectural intent.
